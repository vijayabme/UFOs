# UFOs
## Overview of the Project:
The purpose of this analysis is to create a webpage for UFO sightings. The page we will have an image, title and a table listing the details of UFO sightings across the country. The webpage is customized using Bootstrap and several fully functional filters are added to interact with the table and create visualizations.

Software: Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

## Results
We created an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings. The webpage has the following components.
- Navigation Bar
- Page Header
- Article title
- Article Paragraph
- Table of sightings data
- Filters for the table

The filters are built to filter the table based on the following criteria
- date
- city
- state
- country
- shape of the UFO sighting

For example if we select benton for the city the table will show results for benton.

If we select ca for state it will give all the results for california

If we select multiple filters, shape for sphere and ca for state it will filter based on both the criteria
